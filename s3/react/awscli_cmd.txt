# AWS CLI & S3 Sync Guide

This guide explains how to use the AWS CLI to deploy a React/Vite app to an S3 bucket.

---

## 1. What is AWS CLI?
The **AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)** is a tool to interact with AWS services from your terminal (instead of the AWS Console).

Example:
```bash
aws s3 ls
2. Configure AWS CLI

Before using it, you must configure your AWS credentials:

aws configure


You will be prompted to enter:

AWS Access Key ID

AWS Secret Access Key

Default region (e.g., ap-south-1 for Mumbai)

Output format (json, table, or text)

✅ This stores credentials locally so you don’t enter them every time.

3. Build Your React/Vite App

For Vite projects:

npm run build


This creates a dist/ folder containing your production-ready app.

For Create React App:

npm run build


This creates a build/ folder.

4. What is aws s3 sync?

The command:

aws s3 sync <local-folder> s3://<bucket-name> --delete

Explanation:

sync → Synchronizes files between local and S3.

<local-folder> → The folder on your machine (e.g., dist/).

s3://<bucket-name> → Your S3 bucket name.

--delete → Removes files from S3 that are not in your local folder (keeps S3 clean and updated).

Example:

aws s3 sync dist/ s3://react-weatherapi --delete


This uploads all files from dist/ to the react-weatherapi bucket and deletes old files that don’t exist locally anymore.

5. Other Useful AWS CLI Commands
List all buckets:
aws s3 ls

List files inside a bucket:
aws s3 ls s3://react-weatherapi

Upload a single file:
aws s3 cp dist/index.html s3://react-weatherapi/index.html

Download a file from S3:
aws s3 cp s3://react-weatherapi/index.html ./index.html

6. Typical Deployment Steps (Vite)

Build app:

npm run build


Sync with S3:

aws s3 sync dist/ s3://react-weatherapi --delete


Open the site URL:

http://react-weatherapi.s3-website.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/


✅ That’s it! Now you can update your app with just two commands (npm run build + aws s3 sync ...).

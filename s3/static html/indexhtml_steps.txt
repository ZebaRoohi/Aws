✅ Step 1: Create a Simple HTML File

On your computer, create a file named index.html with this content:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First AWS Website</title>
  </head>
  <body style="font-family: Arial; text-align: center; margin-top: 100px;">
    <h1>Hello from AWS S3!</h1>
    <p>This is my first static website hosted on Amazon S3.</p>
  </body>
</html>


Keep this file ready — we’ll upload it to S3.

✅ Step 2: Create an S3 Bucket

Log in to your AWS Management Console.

Search for S3 → click S3.

Click Create bucket.

Bucket name: must be unique (e.g., zeba-s3-demo-2025).

Region: choose a region near you (e.g., Asia Pacific (Mumbai) ap-south-1).

Uncheck “Block all public access” (because we want the website to be public).

It will warn you → check the confirmation box.

Click Create bucket.

✅ Step 3: Upload Your Website File

Open your new bucket.

Go to Objects tab → click Upload.

Add your index.html file → click Upload.

✅ Step 4: Enable Static Website Hosting

Inside the bucket → Go to Properties tab.

Scroll to Static website hosting → click Edit.

Select Enable.

Hosting type → Host a static website.

Index document → type index.html.

Save changes.

At the bottom of that section, you’ll now see a Bucket website endpoint URL (something like http://zeba-s3-demo-2025.s3-website-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com).

✅ Step 5: Make the File Public

By default, S3 objects are private.

Go to Permissions tab of the bucket.

Scroll to Bucket Policy → click Edit.

Paste this policy (replace YOUR-BUCKET-NAME with your actual bucket name):

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::zeba-s3-demo-2025/*"
    }
  ]
}


Save changes.

Now your index.html will be publicly accessible.

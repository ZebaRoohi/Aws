Step1 : Prepare for Elastic Beanstalk
pip install awsebcli --upgrade 

Step 2: Initialize your app for Elastic Beanstalk

In CMD, go to your project folder where app.js is located. Example:
cd D:\NodeApp   # (replace with your actual project path)

Step3:Initialize EB:

eb init

Select region → choose the same AWS region you used for S3 (e.g., ap-south-1).

Select application name → give a name like node-eb-app.

Select platform → choose Node.js.

Do you want to set up SSH? → type n for now (we’ll skip SSH).

Step4:Create an environment:
eb create node-env
This will create an Elastic Beanstalk environment.

It will take 2–5 minutes to set up.

Step5:Open your app in browser
eb open
